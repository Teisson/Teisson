# 🚀 Marketing Data Engineering Portfolio – Teis Nilsson

Welcome!  
This portfolio highlights my practical experience in **data engineering, marketing analytics, tracking architecture, and automation** — with a strong foundation in **Python, SQL, and first-party data systems**.

Drawing from my background in IT, cybersecurity, and 6+ years of running a marketing agency, and several years as a Salesforce developer I specialize in building **secure, reliable and activation-ready data pipelines** that turn raw marketing data into measurable business impact.
